                    <p class="top-p">1. Finish re-working all git assignments<br>
                        2. Finish the html and css assigments, while learning new techniques in flex-box, float, and Grid<br>

                        or not they were completed or not.<br>
                        A: These goals are definitly within the parameters of being achievable.<br>
                        R: The goals are realistic because I have the knowledge foundation to fulfill them.<br>
                        T: The timely-ness of such goals makes sense becuase they are sequential in my learning docket
                    </p>
                    <h5><strong><em>Reflection</em></strong></h5>
                    <p>The day is almost complete, and I am able to reflect on my accomplishments.  I was able to complete goal 1, 
                        finish re-working all git assignments.  By re-working the assignments, I was able to retain the knowledge I explored earlier.  
                        They were passed and the goal accomplished. I was not able to finish goal 2, finish html and css assignments. I finished the 
                        first 2 versions, while learning new techniques in flex-box and floats.  By exploring tutorials on the web, my knowledge of css and html was increased.  
                        I was not able to finish the last version of the assignment.  Most of my time was spent on goal 1 and the first two versions of goal 2.
                        I think time management was one thing that did not go well that could have improved my chances of completing my goals.  Bouncing between different 
                        projects hindered my effeciency, so for tomorrow I will focus on using my time in a structured manner.</p>

                <div class="goal-2">
                    <h3>Goal 2</h3>
                    <h6>December 11, 2017</h6>
                    <p class="top-p">
                        1. Learn the Basics of CSS grid.<br>
                        2. Finish the the last HTML excersise.<br>
                        3. Work in a different setting other than the class room.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        S. These Goals are specific and describe different but unique aspirations<br>
                        M. These Goals are Measurable, and the completion can be determined after the set amount of time<br>
                        A. These goals are definitely achievable within the time parameters<br>
                        R. These goals are definitely realistic and within the parameters of the day<br>
                        T. These goals make sense within the rubric set by the school.  They are sequential and will 
                        contribute to my knowledge and flow of the curriculum.</p>
                    <h5><strong><em>Reflection</em></strong></h5>
                    <p>Unfortunately none of my goals were met on this day.  I got caught up learning more features 
                        of flex-box, so I was not able to get into CSS grid. I did not realize that the last HTML website excersise 
                        included a second page, so finishing that was not going to be possible.  I  was not able to work in a different part 
                        of the building other than the classroom because I was constantly needing help from the instructor.  On the positive side of things, 
                        I received a lot of help from my instructor and solidified my understanding of flex box.  I also feel really good about completing
                        the HTML last excersise during my next class session.  I also got to know some of my classmates because I stayed in the classroom to work.  
                        Despite not completing my set goals, I think there were some positives that still came from not completing my goals.  
                        Some things I will do differently tomorrow will be:<br>
                            1. Understanding the Entirety of the assignment to get a judge of span of the excersise.<br>
                            2. Taking the time to actually undestand the material before I set a goal to learn other techniques<br>
                            3. Bring a buddy to a different part of the building to work.

                    <h3>Goal 3</h3>
                    <h6>December 15, 2017</h6>
                    <p class="top-p">1. Understand For Loops in order to finish all versions of galvanize money<br>
                        2. Understand Javascript Functions in order to finish all versions of galvanize money<br>
                        3. Attend a meetup on topic I have no knowledge of.<br></p>
                    <p>S- Yes, my goals are describe specific tasks I wish to complete by days end.<br>
                        M- Yes, these goals are measurable and can be valued by either completed or not completed<br>
                        A- Yes, my goals are achievable and are within the paramaters of the day.<br>
                        R- My goals are realistic because they are based off some previous knowledge that I wish to further understand.<br>
                        T- Yes, my goals are timely because they make sense within the curriculumn.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5><strong><em>Reflection</em></strong></h5>
                    <p>After days end, I have met all of my goals and then some.  I have a very good understanding of loops and functions that allowed 
                        me to finish all of the galvanize-money drills.  I was also able to attend a meet-up at turing that discussed React JS, a topic I 
                        previously had no idea about.  I was able to achieve these goals by working and teaching others what I understand about functions and for loops.  
                        By teaching, I solidified my knowledge of these topics.  I was also able to use other people to attend a the meetup. The people I went with offered 
                        me a ride, and without them I probably would not have attended the discussion. I think the most valuable thing that went well was working with other 
                        people rather than trying to tackle these goals by myself.  I think in the future, I will seek out other peoples help and offer to help more classmates 
                        in the future.  It worked well so, I would like to build on that.</p>
