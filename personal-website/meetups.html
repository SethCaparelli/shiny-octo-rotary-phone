                    <p class="top-p">Charlie - Student in G70<br>
                        James - Doesn't work, but used to work for department of Transportation<br>
                        Ross - Student in G70<br>
                        James - Student in G70

                    <h4><em>What I learned</em></h4>
                    <p>I spent most of my time learning flexbox through flexbox froggy.  It was a really great way 
                        to see flexbox work in an application that has immediate feedback. By using different 
                        functions of flexbox, you can arrange and order elements on the web-page.  I also learned a 
                        cool tool called coolors that provides a color pallate based on one color.
                    </p>
                    <h4><em>Questions I Still Have</em></h4>
                    <p>I am still unsure of the order property in flexbox<br>Where does zero start?<br>
                        Is there a presedence?</p>

                    <h4><em>What I learned</em></h4>
                    <p>1. Snapshots are a way to check CSS styles and provide a view of any alterations to the styleguide.<br>
                            2. As a Developer, we must have opinions. People who have an opinion drive the conversation.<br>
                            3. Electron is Github's open sourece frameworks for building cross-platform desktop apps in HTML, 
                            CSS, and JS. Its a wrapper for a browser app.  Main process interacts with native UI of OS -> creates UI of your app.<br>
                            4. Named Data Networking
                    </p>
                    <h4><em>Questions I Still Have</em></h4>
                    <p> Why would there be changes to a styleguide?  Is Snapshot used on an open platform?<br>
                        What application would be a good start for using Electron?<br> 
                        What is Named Data Networking?

                    <p>Jeff - Works out of state.  Had a friend go through Galvanize, so he is checking it out.<br>
                       Colin - Doesnt work. Learning to code.
                    </p>
                    <h4><em>What I learned</em></h4>
                    <p>During this session of code to learn, I spent most of my time working on codewars. 
                        I came across a lot of problems that required me to research javascript elements 
                        I have never come across before.  Elements such as Math.sqrt(),Math.abs(), and Math.pow() 
                        are powerful objects that are very useful in functions that have numbers as parameters. This 
                        led me to research more Math objects in javascript.  I came across Math.min() and Math.max() as well.  
                        These Math objects are great ways to intepret numbers in an arrays. 
                        Towards the end of this meet up, I began to research ways to incorporate tabs into a single page on a website.  
                        The combination of HTML, CSS, and javascript allow you to condense a long webpage with a lot of text into a condensed, 
                        approachable format for users to easliy navigate.</p>
                    <h4><em>Questions I still Have</em></h4>
                    <p>I would still like to explore more of the Math objects in javascript.  Objects such as Math.sin() and Math.tan() are a 
                        couple I fully dont understand their application.<br>
                        I would also don't understand how javascript is incorporated into the creation of tabs. I would like to explore, and eventually 
                        be able to create tabs using javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                    </p>
