                <p>I am learning how to display with flex-box in CSS.  I am learning this becuase it is vital 
                    to know how to display content in CSS.  Flex-box is just one of many techniques used to do 
                    such. I would like to have a basic knowledge of all the techniques and find out which I would 
                    like dive deeper in.  The act of "Playing" is evident in the process of learning, because I am
                    following along with tutorials in my own work. Playing with different code and seeing the results 
                    is the main way I learned the flex-box technique. It took trial and error (mostly error) to see what
                    different lines of code did to the overall output.  It was frustrating at first; but after a while, 
                    things started to click.

                <p>My process of setting the stage has a lot to do with organizing my workspace. 
                        Closing and organizing tabs as well as creating a separate desktop are all 
                        techniques I used to set the stage. Aligning windows so that I can work along the 
                        tutorial is also vital in setting the stage.
                </p>
                <h4><em>Reflection</em></h4>
                <p>By setting the stage in the way I did, I was able to stay focused on the task at hand.  
                    I was not distracted by other tabs like social media, music, or other work tabs.  I 
                    completely separated desktops and turned off irrelevant notifications.  By aligning my 
                    windows, I was able to clearly follow the tutorials in my own work.  With the knowledge 
                    that I have gained, I hope to take flex-box to the next level.  I would like to keep 
                    working with it and eventually incorporate it into my future work as a developer.

                <p>Learning to Deploy websites with Firebase. We have learned the basics of creating a website, 
                    but it is just as important to know how to make your work public.
                </p>
                <h4><em>Setting the Stage</em></h4>
                <p>The process of setting the stage was a little deeper than just clearing tabs and creating a new desktop.  
                    Although I did do these things, there was much more to setting the stage for this topic.  First, I removed 
                    myself from my phone, which is a big distraction.  Secondly, I made sure I had a full water bottle, some snacks,
                    and a quiet space.  This was really important because it removed any excuse to divert from the goal.  Finally, I set my 
                    tabs and desktop to a place that eliminated distractions and allowed for a good work flow
                </p>
                <h4><em>Reflection</em></h4>
                <p>The process of learning this technique involved watching a video and following along.  This was a very foreign concept to me 
                    before, and the video set me up really nicely to learn and apply at the same time.  Once I had the basics down, I was able to 
                    play a little bit and use what I learned to deploy my first site.  I also viewed other videos to get another perspective on how 
                    firebase works and the other applications it can be used for.  By playing with the program, I was able to find things that I  
                    would not have if I were to just watch the tutorial.  The process of setting the stage helped me in that I was void of any
                    distractions.  I was able to clearly focus and learn.  Overall my experience with this technology was very positive.  
                    To be able to quickly deploy a website from the command line is a valuable technique to know in this industry.  I think I have 
                    only grazed the surface of the capabilities of Firebase, and wish to dive deeper into other applications, such as anaylytics.

                <p>Learning For Loops, the most widely used loop in javascript. It seems like a use of Learning to learn.  This essential loop is 
                    very important to understand because of its power in javascript.</p>
                <h4><em>Setting the Stage</em></h4>
                <p>The process of setting the stage was not much different than previous topics.  I of course organized my desktops by closing and moving 
                    tabs. I made sure any discracting websites were put away or closed.  I chose a long mix that I knew I liked so I wouldn't be tempted to 
                    browse through music.  I filled my water bottle and made sure snacks were handy.  Now that I was comfortable, I pulled out my "Javascript 
                    for Kids" book and had a repl.it tab open ready to participate in the examples provided.
                </p>
                <h4><em>Reflection</em></h4>
                <p>The act of "play" was very helpful when learning about for loops.  By coding along with the examples in the book and substituing different 
                    variables and integers, I was able to fully understand the topic.  There was an "ah hah" moment when I realized what all the parts of the for 
                    loop were doing. I think the way I set the stage had a positive effect on my learning of the topic becuase I wasn't distracted, and there was 
                    no need for me to get up and walk away from my computer.  I was fully immersed in the book and examples. The process of actually coding and seeing 
                    the results was the most effective way to understand this topic, and I will surely continue to do so in the future.  Now that I understand the power 
                    of for loops,I can see there application in retrieving and analyzing data.  There use with other loops and functions will be something I plan to continue 
                    to study in the near future.
