                <p>My name is Seth Caparelli, and I am a Colorado native. As most Coloradans do, I love to
                travel the world, but I always love coming home.  I spent most of my 20's in Boulder, CO going
                to school and working as a bartender. I recieved a BA in Creative Advertising as well as a BFA in 
                Ceramics from The University of Colorado Boulder.  The years after college, I traveled as much as a could
                and sustained myself by mixing cocktails.  Up until a few months ago, I was convinced I would spend my life
                behind the bar. I've learned that once you think you have it all figured out, life has a way of proving to you that
                you aren't always in control. In short, my life path met a fork, and I chose the path I am currently walking now. Change
                is not only a natural phenomenon but an exciting one.  I am learning to embrace it.
